1) Domain name server is used to convert the Domain name into the IP addresss

2) Computer uses the DNS to look up the IP address which is used to connect to the destination

DNS servers are connected in a Distributed hierarchy manner like a there

Mostly these zones are split up into something like .org,.com,.gov


DNS is maintained by organizations

When we type a address in web browser first it will look into broswer cache for IP
then OS level , then our router and then ISP DNS resolver and then root server 
and then particular root like .com or .org and at last ends wup with proper IP 
address for our website


If client is broswer all these things are taken care by the broswer itself



From Broswer => ISP recursive DNS resolver(does not IP address but knows where is root)
=> Reach root server (Does not know IP but knows where is particular TLD)
=> Reach TLD DNS server (Does not know IP but knows where is Authority name server (digitalOCean,goDaddy))
=> Reach Authoritative name server and get the valid IP and returns back  



DNS Records 

A Record   => Record domain(hostname) to ipv4 address 

AAAA Record => Record domain(hostname) to ipv6 address 

TXT Record => typically carries a machine reable data 

NS Record => Name server => specifies that a DNS zone such as "example.com" is delegated to
specific Authoritative Name server and it provides the address of the name server 

CNAME Record => Canonical name can be used as alias a hostname to another hostname
