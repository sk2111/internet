IP & Protocols

=> After creating internet to share information from one device to another we need some way
=> IP address and Internet protocol comes at that Time

Protocol

=> A protocol is a set of rules and regulations which allows from device to communicate 
with another so that they can share the information

=> So to use Internet device must need to understand how Internet protocol works 

IP (Internet protocol)

=> Internet uses an IP address and address which will be uniqie for all the devices 
connected to the internet 

DEVICE ==== ISP ==== INTERNET

=> usally or device will be connected to a netwrok which will connect to ISP and ISP takes care of
connecting us to the whole world

IP addressing

IP address is much like an home address it has its meaning

IPV4: 32 bit long => 4 Byte address Designed 1970

    
    174.129.14.120 => maximum => 255.255.255.255 (each is 1 byte for each part )

    => The early address represent the COUNTRY NETWORK 
    => Then comes the REGION NETWORK
    => Then comes the SUBNET NETWORK
    => Then comes the DEVICE

    => IPV4 can support upto 4 billion unique address
    => Due to internet popularity 4 billion is not enough 
    => So we started an transistion to move from IPV4 to IPV6 


IPV6: 16 Byte addressing scheme => 128 bits
    
    2001:0db8:0def:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
    => Made up of hex values
    => Support upto 340 undecillion UNIQUE address

ICANN => Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)

ICANN handles the domain name registration,assigning IP when Domain are registered
which will help the internet to maintain the intgrity
