5) HTTP send the data over network in plain form so it is easy for attackers to snoop the information

6) HTTPS comes into play to provide an extra encryption over the data we will use to send

Here in HTTPS the server will send an digital certificate of veryfying the identity and then
broswers will verify it and enable a HTTPS connection (TLS) so that the data packets will be encrypted
