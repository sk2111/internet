=> Introduced in 1970 as a result of ARPANET 

=> Internet is a distributed network system which helps us to move information from one place 
to another

=> Internet is not an centralized system but its is disturbed like and mesh so nobody owns it 
or we can say like everybody owns them 

=> The main idea of internet is splitting the message into chunks and sending the chunk in the
switched packet network as fast as possible

=> The core concept is even though there is no end to end connectivity they are motivated by the 
factor they will be an end to end connectivity 


INTERNET WIRES,WIFI,CABLES

=> In Internet everything will be in binary that is 1 or 0
    8bit = 1byte
    1024 byte = 1 kilobyte
    1024 kilobyte = 1 Megabyte

=> Earlier days we used morse code,telegrapgh to communicate binary information

=> But these methods are error prone and really slow

=> At present people use electricity,light,radio waves to transmit binary information

BANDWIDTH

=> Bandwidth is the measure of number of bits transmitted at a given transmitted
=> High bandwidth => fast information sharing 

LATENCY

=> Time taken for one bit to move from start to end


DIFFERENT MEDIUMS TO TRANSFER THESE 

ELECTRICITY => cheap but long distance signal loss (few hundreds feet)
LIGHT => long distance fibre optics, very fast but costly

WIRELESS: 

Radio waves => Machines will convert the binary information into 1 and 0 and encode them in 
AM radio and FM radio waves

Totally mobile but limited distance is short
