1) HTML from the network layer will be parsed to construct the DOM tree
2) The DOM tree will be formed from HTML and CSSOM from CSSOM
3) Parallel to this the Renderer tree or render object will be created
4) Render object will resemble the DOM except it does not include the elements which are
    not a part of UI like head tag display:none except
5) Render tree does not have height,,width associated with it 
6) Render object has methods like flow , paint 
7) After render object is constructed flow function will be called which takes care of the
   layout process adding height/width
8) Once the layout / flow process is done then painting will be involved which generates the UI we see

  HTML => RENDER OBJECT => FLOW/LAYOUT => PAINTING
