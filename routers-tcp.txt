1) When a server and client is transfering data over the network there wont be any 
dedicated connection established between them 

2) When sending an internet it is usually slit into multiple chunks of packets

3) There packets are send over the netwrok and routers takes care of sending them to destination
in different direction depending upon netwrok traffic etc 

4) In order to the internet to be relaible IP protocol comes along with TCP

5) Transmission Control Protocol ensures the delivery of the packets to the destination 

6) If some packets are lost in the transmission TCP takes care of requesting that packets 
again and it makes sure that every packet is received

Thus TCP/IP plays a important role in internet reliablity and scalablity
